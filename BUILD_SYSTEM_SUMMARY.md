- ✅ Automated validation before building
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting
- ✅ Unity Editor menu integration
- ✅ Command-line build automation

## 📱 Build Outputs

### Development APK
- **Location**: `Builds/Development/MRChess-Dev.apk`
- **Features**: Debug symbols, profiler support, development logging
- **Usage**: Development and testing

### Release APK
- **Location**: `Builds/Release/MRChess.apk`
- **Features**: Optimized, minified, production-ready
- **Usage**: Distribution and final deployment

## 🚀 How to Build

### Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# Validate project setup
./build.sh development --validate-only

# Build development APK
./build.sh development

# Build release APK
./build.sh release
```

### Unity Editor
1. Open `MR Chess > Validate Build Setup` to check configuration
2. Use `MR Chess > Build Development APK` or `MR Chess > Build Release APK`
3. Use `MR Chess > Fix Common Build Issues` if problems occur
