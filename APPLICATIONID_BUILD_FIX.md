# ApplicationId Build Error Fix ✅

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Gradle build failure:
```
Library projects cannot set applicationId. applicationId is set to 'com.DefaultCompany.MRChess' in default config.
```

## Root Cause
Unity was somehow trying to apply the `applicationId` setting to a library project. Android library projects (using `com.android.library` plugin) cannot have an `applicationId` - only application projects (using `com.android.application` plugin) can have one.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Validated Template Configuration ✅
- **mainTemplate.gradle**: Uses `com.android.application` with `applicationId` (✅ Correct)
- **unityLibrary.gradle**: Uses `com.android.library` without `applicationId` (✅ Correct)
- **unityLibraryTemplate.gradle**: Uses `com.android.library` without `applicationId` (✅ Correct)

### 2. Cleaned Build Cache ✅
- Removed `Library/Bee/Android/` completely
- Removed `Library/BuildPlayerData/`
- Removed `Library/LastBuild.buildreport`
- This forces Unity to regenerate all Gradle files from templates

### 3. Removed Backup Files ✅
- Deleted all `.backup` files that might confuse Unity
- Ensured only clean, correct templates exist

### 4. Enhanced Build Tools ✅
- Added `FixApplicationIdIssues()` function to GradleBuildFixer
- Added automatic detection and removal of rogue `applicationId` entries
- Updated `Fix All Android Issues` to include this check

## Current Template Status

| File | Plugin Type | ApplicationId | Status |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| `mainTemplate.gradle` | `com.android.application` | ✅ Has `applicationId` | ✅ Correct |
| `unityLibrary.gradle` | `com.android.library` | ❌ No `applicationId` | ✅ Correct |
| `unityLibraryTemplate.gradle` | `com.android.library` | ❌ No `applicationId` | ✅ Correct |

## Prevention
The enhanced GradleBuildFixer now includes:
- Automatic validation of applicationId settings
- Detection of library projects with applicationId
- One-click fix for all Android build issues

## Next Steps
1. The Android build should now work correctly
2. Use **MR Chess → Fix All Android Issues** for comprehensive fixing
3. Use **MR Chess → Fix ApplicationId Issues** for this specific problem
