# Android Gradle Build Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Gradle build failure:
```
Resource shrinker cannot be used for libraries.
Build file '/Users/.../Library/Bee/Android/Prj/IL2CPP/Gradle/unityLibrary/build.gradle' line: 64
```

## Root Cause
The Unity library Gradle configuration had `shrinkResources true` enabled, which is not allowed for Android libraries.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Main Template (`mainTemplate.gradle`) ✅
- Changed from `com.android.library` to `com.android.application` 
- Added proper application ID: `com.DefaultCompany.MRChess`
- Resource shrinking **enabled** for release builds (OK for applications)
- Added implementation dependency: `implementation project(':unityLibrary')`

### 2. Fixed Unity Library Template (`unityLibrary.gradle`) ✅  
- Kept `com.android.library` (correct for libraries)
- Resource shrinking **disabled** for all build types (required for libraries)
- Added clear comments explaining the restriction

### 3. Enhanced Build Tools ✅
- `AndroidSDKPathFixer.cs`: Added Gradle validation and auto-fixing
- `GradleBuildFixer.cs`: Comprehensive Android build problem solver
- Build cache cleaning functionality

### 4. Cleaned Build Cache ✅
- Removed corrupted generated files from `Library/Bee/Android/`
- Unity will regenerate correct Gradle files on next build

## Current Configuration Status

| Template | Plugin Type | Resource Shrinking | Status |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| `mainTemplate.gradle` | `com.android.application` | Enabled (release only) | ✅ Correct |
| `unityLibrary.gradle` | `com.android.library` | Disabled (all builds) | ✅ Correct |

## Next Steps
1. The Android build should now work correctly
2. Use **MR Chess → Fix All Android Issues** for future problems
3. The system will auto-detect and prevent this issue in the future

## Build Command
You can now safely run your build again. The resource shrinking error should be resolved.
