# Development Log

## Project Milestones

### Phase 1: Core Setup âœ…
- [x] Unity project structure
- [x] Chess engine implementation
- [x] MR components (spatial anchoring)
- [x] XR Interaction Toolkit integration
- [x] Basic AI engine
- [x] Git repository initialization

### Phase 2: Unity Integration (In Progress)
- [ ] Import chess piece 3D models
- [ ] Configure URP materials and lighting
- [ ] Set up XR Origin and camera rig
- [ ] Create chess board prefab
- [ ] Implement piece prefabs with colliders
- [ ] Configure XR interaction components

### Phase 3: MR Implementation
- [ ] Spatial anchor placement system
- [ ] Hand tracking integration
- [ ] Passthrough configuration
- [ ] Real-world surface detection
- [ ] Board persistence across sessions

### Phase 4: Game Logic Integration
- [ ] Connect 3D pieces to chess logic
- [ ] Move validation with visual feedback
- [ ] Turn management system
- [ ] Game state UI
- [ ] AI opponent integration

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Sound effects and haptic feedback
- [ ] Visual polish (animations, particles)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Device testing and debugging
- [ ] User experience refinement

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separates UI from game logic
- **Component-based**: Unity's ECS approach for modularity  
- **Event-driven**: Loose coupling between systems

### Key Technologies
- **OpenXR**: Cross-platform XR standard
- **Meta Quest SDK**: Hand tracking and passthrough
- **URP**: Performance optimized for Quest
- **XR Interaction Toolkit**: Standardized XR interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Object pooling for chess pieces
- Optimized materials and textures
- Efficient spatial queries
- Frame rate targeting 72/90 FPS

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Chess piece 3D models not included (need to be created/imported)
- Unity scene files not generated (requires Unity editor)
- XR configuration requires manual setup
- Meta Quest SDK integration needs Asset Store import

### Future Improvements
- Online multiplayer support
- Chess puzzle mode
- Tournament system
- Replay system
- Advanced AI difficulty settings

## Code Quality

### Standards Followed
- Unity C# coding conventions
- XML documentation for public APIs
- Async/await for XR operations
- Error handling and logging
- Unit test structure preparation

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Components are properly documented
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Performance impact is considered
- [ ] XR interactions are accessible
